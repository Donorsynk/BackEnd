DonorSynk Smart Contract Overview
Introduction
DonorSynk is a smart contract built on the Ethereum blockchain, designed to manage and track blood donations in hospitals. It is written in Solidity, the primary language for creating smart contracts on the Ethereum platform. The contract adheres to the ERC20 standard, a widely-accepted protocol for issuing and managing tokens on the Ethereum blockchain.

Purpose of the Contract
The main objective of the DonorSynk contract is to offer a transparent, secure, and efficient system for managing blood donations. It aims to simplify the process of blood donation, from donor registration to tracking blood types and volumes in hospitals.

The contract ensures that all transactions related to blood donations are recorded on the blockchain, providing a transparent and immutable record. This can help to increase trust and confidence among donors, hospitals, and other stakeholders in the blood donation process.

Contract Structure
The DonorSynk contract is composed of several key components:

ERC20 Token: The contract inherits from the ERC20 token standard, which provides basic functionalities such as transferring tokens, getting the balance of an address, and the total supply of tokens.

Hospital Structure: This structure represents a hospital in the system. It includes the owner of the hospital, the hospital's name, a URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) for the hospital, a mapping of donors' data, an array of all donor IDs, an ID for the hospital, and a BloodType structure.

Donors Structure: This structure represents a donor in the system. It includes the government ID of the donor, a URI for the donor, the status of the donor (whether they are active or not), the blood type of the donor, the address of the donor, and the date of donation.

BloodType Structure: This structure represents the different types and volumes of blood available in a hospital. It includes the volumes of A+, A-, B+, B-, AB+, AB-, O+, and O- blood types.

Contract Functions
The DonorSynk contract includes several functions that allow for the management and tracking of blood donations. These include:

confirmBloodDonation: This function is used to confirm a blood donation. It takes in parameters such as the name of the donor, the ID of the donor, the blood type of the donor, the new volume of blood donated, and the address of the donor.

showMyHospital: This function allows a user to view their associated hospital. It takes in the address of the user and returns the URI and name of the hospital.

transfer: This function allows for the transfer of tokens from one address to another. It takes in the address to transfer to and the amount to transfer.

decreaseAllowance: This function decreases the allowance of a spender. It takes in the address of the spender and the value to subtract from the spender's allowance.

Conclusion
In conclusion, the DonorSynk contract is a powerful tool for managing and tracking blood donations in a transparent and efficient manner. By leveraging the power of blockchain technology, it provides a solution that can help to improve the blood donation process and increase trust among all stakeholders.
